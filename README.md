<p>
    This project is designed to predict the presence of pneumonia in X-ray images. The prediction output is binary: "1" indicates the presence of pneumonia, and "0" indicates no pneumonia.

    To train the model, please follow these steps:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Download the X-ray image dataset for pneumonia detection.</li>
    <li>Preprocess the data and split it into training and testing sets.</li>
    <li>Train the model using your preferred machine learning or deep learning framework.</li>
</ol>
